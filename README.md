## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

**stage one:**

This piece embodies an unconventional view of time across the life span of a person by playing with and expressing the changing perspective of time as a person changes. A calendar expression of the date progresses to a semi-random date, at a randomly fluctuating rate. This reflects how the apparent pace of time changes at different times in our lives, similar to the phrase "time flies when you're having fun" but applied across multiple events in the persons random lifetime. As this person passes half of their lifetime being spent, they reflect on how time never appears to pass the same. The screen fades from white to black and the text on screen from black to red, relfecting the advancement of the persons mortality. Finally, upon "death", "IT IS OVER" reinforces the weight of the inevitable death, whilst another text hints at perhaps repeating life in another random lifetime.
